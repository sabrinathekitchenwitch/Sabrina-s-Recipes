\textbf{Procedure:}
\medskip


\begin{enumerate}
\item Note: You will need to reduce to 2 cups of liquid, you can estimate this by pouring exactly two cups of water into the saucepan you plan to use for the posset, then take a ruler, wooden skewer or chopstick and put it in the water. Mark the level of the water on the ruler.
\item Note: One of the lemons is for zesting, you can empty it out for presentation but it will not be as pretty as the others. 
\item Cut the lemons in half vertically and use a sturdy spoon to scoop out the insides into a medium bowl. Keep this as you will need the juice. 
\item In a medium (preferably deep) saucepan, combine the cream, sugar and lemon zest. Bring to a boil over medium heat and cook, stirring frequently, to dissolve the sugar.  Don't walk away from the mixture as it can easily boil over and it will be \textit{incredibly} sticky. If it gets close to the top, remove the pan briefly from the heat to slow the boil.

\item Cook until the mixture reduces to exactly two cups. (see first note) Remove from the heat and add the lemon juice. Set the saucepan aside to cool until a skin forms on top, about 20 minutes. Strain the posset through a fine mesh strainer into a bowl. Discard the lemon zest.

\item Divide the mixture between the lemon halves or serving bowls. Refrigerate, uncovered, until set, about 2-3 hours. Once fully chilled, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for up to 2 days.  

\item To serve, unwrap and allow to rest at room temperature for 10 minutes before serving. Garnish with berries and serve.
