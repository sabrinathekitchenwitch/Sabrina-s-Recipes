\medskip


\begin{enumerate}
\item Preheat oven to 250 degrees F. Grease a large baking sheet. (Do NOT use parchment paper or foil. Bake directly on the greased pan).
\item In a small bowl, combine sugar, sea salt, and cinnamon, set aside.
\item In a large mixing bowl, whip egg white and vanilla with a whisk until frothy (about 1 minute).
\item Add almonds to wet mixture and stir until evenly coated.

\item Once almonds are coated, sprinkle the dry ingredients over the almonds and stir until evenly distributed. Make sure to scrape any extra cinnamon sugar mixture off the sides and bottom of the bowl and incorporate it into the almonds.

\item Spread the almonds evenly, in a single layer, on the prepared baking sheet.


\item Bake at 250 degrees F for 1 hour. Stir every 15 minutes. Even if they look done after 45 minutes trust me and bake for the full hour.
